    <p>Hebei University of Science and Technology is grappling with the fallout from the retraction of a prominent paper on
        gene editing.</p>
    <h1>Discredited gene-editing researcher vows to clear his name </h1>
    <h3>By Yongming Huang Aug. 4, 2017 , 1:45 PM</h3>
    <p>A Chinese biologist whose team on Wednesday retracted a high-proﬁle paper on a gene-editing technology has vowed to press
        ahead with experiments that he hopes will vindicate the potential rival to the CRISPR/Cas9 system.</p>
    <p>In May 2016, Chunyu Han of Hebei University of Science and Technology in Shijiazhuang, China, and colleagues published
        a paper in Nature Biotechnology describing a gene-editing system using an enzyme, Argonaute nuclease, from the organism Natronobacterium
        gregoryi(NgAgo). The technology was hailed on social media as Nobel Prize–worthy work and Han, the paper’s lead author,
        rose to fame in China. He was elected vice president of Hebei Association for Science and Technology and conferred
        the title of “most beautiful teacher in Hebei.” That August, Hebei government ofﬁcials approved a plan to establish
        a $32 million gene-editing research center at the university. The fate of the center is unclear; Chinese journalists
        who visited Hebei University of Science and Technology reportedly could not locate the center, and staff said they
        were unaware of it.
    </p>
    <p>Han’s star began to fall late last year, when independent labs in China, South Korea, Germany, and the United States
        began reporting their failures to replicate the paper’s key result. In a 3 August statement, Han’s team acknowledged
        that “so far there is no second paper showing NgAgo-gDNA can be used for gene-editing.” Last January, a patent on
        the NgAgo technology that Han and a colleague applied for in 2015 was effectively withdrawn after the duo failed
        to respond inquiries from China’s State Intellectual Property Ofﬁce, the ofﬁce’s online database shows.

    <p>Han’s team continues to stand by their ﬁndings, stating that “when key requirements are met, the NgAgo-gDNA system can
        effectively edits genes.” They did not reveal what the “key requirements” are. And they are pressing for another
        attempt to independently verify that the NgAgo system works. “Our next step, in response to social concerns, is to
        do the relevant work in accordance with the school arrangements, to select a third party laboratory, accompanied
        by peer experts to carry out experiments to verify the efﬁciency of NgAgo-gDNA gene-editing technology and publish
        the results,” they stated. Han could not be reached for comment.
    </p>
    <p>“They feel like the NgAgo technology is still possible. But I think the possibility is minimal,” says Bo Tang, a molecular
        biologist at China Agricultural University in Beijing who uses CRISPR/Cas9 technology in his research. “Now [Han]
        is on thin ice,” he says</p>
